The methods presented will include tools for visualising epicurves, estimating transmissibility, deriving short term predictions of incidence, modelling infectious disease dynamics and assessing the impact of intervention strategies. The course will consist of lectures during the mornings and hands-on practical in the afternoon. All practicals will be using the R software. A basic knowledge of R will be assumed from the participants."
